# Introduction

Dark Elixir is a functional and dynamically typed programming language for writing small reliable scripts and networking purposes

Dark Elixir is inspired from the modern and popular programming language "Elixir" to give the conciese syntax of Elixir outside of EVM. The Dark Elixir's interpreter is 100% implemented using Java. This was started as a hobby project and eventually turned into a complete programming language.

## Why Dark Elixir?

**Functional Programming**: Dark Elixir is a functional programming language that encourages immutable data structures, pure functions, and pattern matching. This paradigm promotes code clarity, testability, and maintainability.

**Open Source**: Dark Elixir is completely open source and it is MIT Licensed. You can contribute to the project on Github.

**Immutablity**: Dark Elixir is a functional programming language, which means all of the variables are immutable and functions does not provide any side effects

**Developer Productivity**: Dark Elixir has a clear and readable syntax which is inspired by of course Elixir. The language emphasizes developer productivity, making it easier and more enjoyable to write code.

:::danger Early Stages
Dark Elixir is still in its very early stages so it may contain a lot of bugs and doesn't not include any functionalities. If there is an issue, feel free to raise it in the Github repo of [Dark Elixir](https://github.com/Jenin-Immanuel/DarkElixir-Java)

## Let's Get Started!

Now that you have an overview of what Dark Elixir is and why it's worth exploring, let's dive into the world of Dex lang. In the next sections, we will explore the syntax, data types, and much more

Feel free to explore the documentation, experiment with the code examples, and embrace the functional and dynamic nature of Dark Elixir. Happy coding!
