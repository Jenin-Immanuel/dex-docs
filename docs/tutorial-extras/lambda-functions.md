# Lambda Functions

Lambda functions or Anonymous functions are created with the keyword `fn`

```
> add = fn x -> x + 1 end
> add(1)
2
```

The syntax of creating a lambda function is the keyword followed by args and then the `->` operator followed by the return expr and ending with end keyword

```
fn <arg/args> -> <return-expr> end
```
