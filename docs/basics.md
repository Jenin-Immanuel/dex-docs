# Basics

# Hello, World

Now that you have installed Dark Elixir, it's time to write your first Dark Elixir program. We'll start by printing a basic and traditional `Hello World`

## Creating the Script File

All the Dark Elixir files should end with .dx suffix. It doesn't matter where you create the file as long as you can navigate to the respective file

Here Let's say `test.dx`

Now type in

```python
print("Hello World")
```

print() is the output function in Dark Elixir which is used to print text on the console. It takes in one argument and prints it on the console

## Run the program

To run the program, first save the file and open the terminal and navigate to the directory where the `test.dx` file is located. And in that type

```shell
dex test.dx
```

This will run the script and print the text "Hello World" on the screen.
